Overview
========

A Python module for generating and analysing metal-organic cages formed
from subcomponent self-assembly.

Code is for the paper at DOI: XX

If you have any issues contact me at `andrew dot tarzia at gmail dot com`

Installation
============

To install this code, you can clone this repo. It is written to be used following the workflow below.

Dependancies:

The file `environment.yml` defines a Python 3.9 conda env used for this project.

The file `env_set.py` sets the directories used in this work based on my workstation (Ubuntu 18, 20 or 22). This will require editting for any other machine.

The external software used:

`CREST` version `2.9` from https://github.com/crest-lab/crest

`Gulp` version `5,1` from http://gulp.curtin.edu.au/gulp/

`Shape` version `2.1` from http://www.ee.ub.edu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=575:shape-available&catid=80:news&Itemid=466


Workflow used
=============

**Note** The file `env_set.py` sets the directories used in this work based on my workstation (Ubuntu 18, 20 or 22). This will require editting for any other machine.

I attempt to highlight steps based on their part in the process (e.g. construction or analysis). Not all steps are necessary for what a user may want to do. Although, this project was so involved that many parts of the code are inter-related in an inconveniant to new usage. If so, please contact me for suggestions.
